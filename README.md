# Voxel racer - an indie project developed by me personally (and executed in voxel graphics for Android OS), or an attempt to create a simple but interesting game (not updated for a long time, old project)

# SnowBall Game - a test task that contains an example of my use of the Spine plugin

# Student history - the current project I am working on at the moment will soon be announced in the Play Market
